==========================================
PVT files follow the format of 
Time, Displacement, output velocity,
Time, Displacement, output velocity,

for a single stage that is moving. the output velocity will be the output velocity of the next step
so if you would like the stage to pause somewhere you need to put a 0 at the end of that step. This is not 
the same as the velocity that the stage will execute the step with. That velocity will be calculated by the 
stage aswell as the jerk and acceleration
